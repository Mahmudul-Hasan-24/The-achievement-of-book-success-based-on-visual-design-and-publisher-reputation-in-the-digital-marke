"""# ðŸ§  Opinion Dynamics Under External Shocks â€“ An Agent-Based Modeling Approach

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project models **opinion dynamics** in a population using an **agent-based simulation**.  
The focus is on understanding how **external shocks** (such as policy changes or major events) affect:
- Time to reach consensus
- Stability of opinions
- Level of polarization in the network

## ðŸ§  Model Description

### Agents
- Each agent represents an individual with a binary opinion (0 or 1).

### Network Topology
- **Small-world network** generated using the Wattsâ€“Strogatz model to mimic real-world social networks.

### Dynamics
At each time step:
1. A random agent observes a neighbor.
2. The agent adopts the neighbor's opinion with probability `p`.
3. At predefined intervals, an **external shock** flips the opinions of a subset of agents.

### Observables
- **Consensus Time** â€“ number of steps until all agents share the same opinion.
- **Polarization** â€“ fraction of agents holding each opinion over time.
- **Stability** â€“ effect of repeated shocks on long-term opinion distribution.

## ðŸ“Š Key Results

| Scenario             | Finding |
|--------------------|--------|
| No External Shock  | Consensus is typically reached quickly (few thousand steps). |
| Small Shocks       | Delay consensus and keep diversity longer. |
| Large/Frequent Shocks | Can prevent consensus entirely, leading to oscillating majority opinion. |
